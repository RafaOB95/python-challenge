Challenge_3

You will find 2 folders, in each folder there are two aditionals folders (analysis and resources) and a file (main.py).

You do not have to change anything except for the second excercise, if you want to run succesfully the PyPoll/main.py file you have to change the interpreter to ('base':conda) of the VSC since I worked with pandas for the second excercise.
