Challenge_3

You will find 2 folders, in each folder there are two aditionals folders (analysis and resources) and a file (main.py).

You do not have to change anything except for the second excercise, if you want to run succesfully the PyPoll/main.py file you have to change the interpreter to ('base':conda) of the VSC since I worked with pandas for the second excercise. I donÂ´t know why but I had to close and open the VSC everytime I want to run pandas...

I found here: https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-basics/python-write-text-file/ how to create a text file in Python.
